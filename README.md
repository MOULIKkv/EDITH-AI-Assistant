# EDITH-AI-Assistant
A voice-controlled AI assistant built with Python, Kivy, and Google's Gemini API.

The 5 Core Libraries
kivy 💻
This is the main framework used to build the entire graphical user interface (GUI), including the buttons, text, and layout.
google-generativeai 🧠
This is the official Google library that allows our app to connect to the Gemini AI model, which acts as EDITH's brain.
pyttsx3 🗣️
This library handles Text-to-Speech (TTS), enabling EDITH to speak the answers out loud.
speech_recognition 👂
This library handles Speech-to-Text (STT), listening to your voice commands through the microphone and converting them into text.
PyAudio 🎤
This is a crucial dependency that the speech_recognition library needs to access and capture audio from your microphone.
